            <p>Our library uses Congress Classification System which I would recommend you to get familiar with. It will
              make your life easier navigating inside the library and most of the other libraries in the World. There
              may be minor differences but usually the topics are mapped to letter pairs like the following:</p>

            <p>These letters are followed by some numbers and a year indicating the publication year of the book. This
              data forms what we call the <strong>call number</strong> of a book. Here is an example call number(QA76.6
              .C811 2009) for the book <em>"Introduction to Algorithms":</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <p>The one we are considering in this post is the letter <strong>Q</strong>, more specifically

            <p>Q: Science<br><strong>QA: Mathematics &amp; Computer Science</strong><br>QB: Astronomy<br>QC:

            <h3 id="structure-of-the-guide">Structure of The Guide</h3>
            <p><strong>Important Notice</strong>: I have learnt that call number range cards are changing based on the
              number of books transferred to the storage and the new books that are added to the shelves. Hence, it will
              be much better to use this guide based on subjects instead of the range cards. </p>
            <p>In the library each bookshelf has a card in both top corners indicating the range of call numbers that
              they are holding, they look like this:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <p>The guide will make use of these cards because each bookshelf corresponds to some specific topics. The
              guide will be categorized with these cards representing a bookshelf along with the topics included in that
              bookshelf. After the discussion of the types of books being present in the bookshelf, I will
              <strong>highlight</strong> some of the books that are worth reading if you are interested in the topic
              included in the shelf. There is a preview image of each highlight and you can click the caption under
              these images to visit the library catalog page for that book.</p>
            <p><em>Note: </em>For the topics that I am not that familiar with, I will use Amazon ratings and comments of
              the books to decide whether they are remarkably good for learning the subject or not.</p>

            <p>We are starting with some meta topics. This shelf includes many books related to philosophy of science,
              approaching science and research methodologies which I think can be useful for someone who is interested
              in conducting scientific research in the future. Then the shelf has some biography books related to
              scientists such as Leonardo Da Vinci and Al-Biruni. Lastly the shelf includes a reasonable amount of books
              related to Chaos Theory, which I would recommend looking into if you enjoy fractals. If you don't, I
              recommend you to watch <a

            <p>Here are my recommendations from this shelf:</p>
            <p><strong>1. What If? by Randall Munroe</strong><br>The author of this book is the same as the author of
              the XKCD comics. I would recommend checking the comics as well If you haven't heard of it yet. As the book
              cover tells, the book starts by asking absurd hypothetical questions and tires to approach them in a
              really technical way, it is really fun to read.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <p><strong>2. Chaos by James Gleick</strong><br>This is a fascinating book related to chaos theory and the
              language is really beginner friendly. If you enjoyed the video related to Mandelbrot Sets above, this will
              be an excellent read for you.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->

            <h5 id="-q325-s48-qa9-65-s666-">(Q325 .S48 - QA9.65 .S666)</h5>
            <p>This bookshelf contains a wide variety of topics so brace for impact while you are scanning through the
              books. The shelf starts with some theoretical Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning books. It
              includes the famous Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach book by Russel. Then there are several
              books related to Information Theory and almost all of them are really good. I will pick some of them in
              the highlights and give more detail. Finally the shelf includes brilliant books related to mathematical
              proof writing, logic etc. I would recommend picking one if you are willing to learn some formalism.  Here
              are some pictures from the shelves for having a taste of what the books are like:</p>

            <h3 id="highlights-1">Highlights</h3>
            <p>Here are my recommendations from this shelf:</p>
            <p><strong>1. A First Course In Information Theory by Reymond W. Yeung</strong></p>
            <p>As the title suggests this is a book for the ones who are willing to learn about Information Theory and
              have not studied it before. I would recommend getting familiar with Probability Theory before dealing with
              this. But still it has great introductory chapters explaining some probability concepts such as Markov
              Chains in great detail with necessary examples and readable proofs.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <p><strong>2. Mathematical Proofs by Gary Chartrand</strong></p>
            <p>This is a comprehensive book related to proof writing and  for people who are willing to learn advanced
              mathematics. I personally like the style of the author and the way of explaining the general structure of
              a proof. The book starts with basic building blocks of logic and set theory. Additionally, It has specific
              chapters related to proofs in Number Theory, Calculus and Group Theory. This book is also used in MATH123
              - Abstract Mathematics I course by some instructors.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <p><strong>3.  Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Stuart J. Russel and Peter Norvig</strong></p>
            <p>This is a really comprehensive covering most of the concepts related to Artificial Intelligence. It has
              1152 pages(good luck!).  I don't have enough information for describing the book contents or it's level
              since I haven't read it. But it is obvious that the book is really good since the authors are pioneers in
              the field of AI.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->

            <p>Here are my recommendations from this shelf:</p>
            <p><strong>1. A Mind at Play: How Claude Shannon Invented the Information Age by Jimmy Soni</strong><br>This
              is a biography of Claude Shannon. There many interesting anecdotes from his life and it is really
              enjoyable to read some excerpts from the life of a great thinker.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <p><strong>2. Proofs from THE BOOK by Martin Aigner</strong><br>This book contains a selection of proofs
              from different topics in mathematics, if you are familiar with proofs and enjoy reading and learning
              interesting proofs about different topics, this will be an enjoyable read. Additionally the book is
              dedicated to Paul Erdos and <em>" THE BOOK"</em> is a reference to his quote <em>"You don't have to
                <strong>believe</strong> in God, but you should <strong>believe in The Book</strong>."</em></p>
            <!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <p><strong>3. Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science by Graham, Knuth,
                Patashnik</strong><br>I consider this as the best Discrete Mathematics book ever written with the
              intended audience as Computer Scientists, no wonder the library has 7 copies of this. It covers wide range
              of topics and it has a dedicated chapter to Asymptotic Methods which is not usually present in other
              Discrete Mathematics books. Even if you have taken MATH132 - Discrete Mathematics, I would still recommend
              reading through some chapters since it is a different experience.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->

            <p>This shelf contains a variety of books which I could not categorize properly because it feels a little
              bit random, basically it contains books related to many topics but they are really old. The first column
              has many books related to well known math exams such as GRE, SAT and PUTNAM. There are also some books
              related to the history of computation. Finally this shelf contains a book which I think is really
              important and it is going to be the only highlight. Here are some pictures from the shelves for having a

                Computer Systems course</a> from Carnegie Mellon University. As the title suggests it guides you through
              systems programming concepts with lots of programming exercises. Each chapter has a dedicated lab which
              takes a reasonable amount of time to complete and it is really fun. Even if you are not interested in
              system programming I can guarantee that this book will make you a more experienced person in many concepts
              related to programming and how computers work in general. </p>
            <p>Additionally you can follow the video lectures and find all resources related to labs given in the book

                website</a> and it is free. There are two editions of this book in our library which are the second and
              third. The third edition is almost the same as the second but the architecture is 64-bit instead of
              32-bit. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->

            <p><strong>1. Parallel Computer Architecture by David E. Culler</strong></p>
            <p>I can not say that this book is good for "learning" Parallel Programming but it acts more like a
              reference that you can always reach when you need a detailed insight related to Parallel Computer
              Architectures. If you are interested in this topic, there are many free online resources <a

            <p>This shelf is dedicated to books related to Algorithms and Data Structures and contains many useful and
              fundamental books related to the area. I think the importance of the topics is self explanatory so there
              is not much to say. This shelf also contains some books related to Parallel Programming Algorithms that are
              left from the previous shelf. Here are some pictures from the shelves for having a taste of what the books

            <h3 id="highlights-5">Highlights</h3>
            <p>Here are my recommendations from this shelf:</p>
            <p><strong>1. The Art of Computer Programming by Donald E. Knuth</strong></p>
            <p>This book is referred as the Bible of Computer Science. The writing style of Donald Knuth is well known
              and how he communicates with the reader is really remarkable. This can be seen in the Concrete Mathematics
              book which is previously suggested as well. The book has 4 volumes that focuses on different aspects. I
              have only completed half of the first volume and it is completely fascinating to see the perspective that
              Knuth gives you even for the topics that look really simple and trivial at the first glance. Most of the
              algorithms are written in an assmebly-like language which is introduced in the beginning of the first
              volume in order to reduce the differences in the algorithms depending on different language paradigms. The
              books also have an algorithm for reading the book itself which is pretty cool. So start reading these as
              soon as you can.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->

            <p>This book is always recognized if you just say <em>"CLRS"</em> which is the initials of the authors. It
              is the de facto textbook that is being used in most of the Algorithms courses in many universities
              including CS473: Algorithms I from Bilkent University. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->

            <p><strong>1. The C Programming Language by  Brian Kernighan &amp; Dennis Ritchie</strong></p>
            <p>This book is the bible of C. It is from the designer of the language Dennis Ritchie (if you already don't
              know). It contains many examples after each chapter which makes you get familiar with most of the
              constructs in C. Note that the second version is for ANSI C and the current standard is C11 but having a
              good grasp of ANSI C would be enough for general use. At least it will be a good practice to solve the

            <p><strong>1. Compilers: Principles, Techniques &amp; Tools by Aho, Lam, Sethi, Ullman</strong></p>
            <p>You can see this book referred as the Dragon Book in most of the discussions online. That's because the
              fancy cover that the book has. The book has a legendary status for being frequently used in Compiler
              Design Courses in many universities.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <p><strong>2. Essential Linux Device Drivers by Sreekrishnan Venkateswaran</strong></p>
            <p>I have used this book as a reference while reading another book related to Linux Kernel Development. It
              is quite comprehensive and goes into detail but it also captures the big pictures while doing that. I
              should also note that the book is a little bit outdated considering the current version of the Linux

            <p>This section has variety of books related to different computer systems and architectures. At first we
              have many reference books related to legacy systems such as IBM PC, Old Windows and Macintosh Versions
              etc. Additionally there are many books related to system programming such as books related to assembly
              programming or developing unix applications. Here are some pictures from the shelves for having a taste of
              what the books are like:</p><!--kg-card-begin: gallery-->
            <h3 id="highlights-10">Highlights</h3>
            <p>Here are my recommendations from this shelf:</p>
            <p><strong>1. Assembly Language for x86 Processors by Kip Irvine</strong></p>
            <p>I can claim that most of my knowledge related to x86 assembly comes from this book. Instead of using
              custom libraries the book has its own library that is used in many places in the book so that the book is
              self contained in a sense. I like this style very much. There are many practical exercises and code
              examples that makes you understand the internals very well.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <p><strong>2. The Linux Programming Interface by Kerrisk Michael</strong></p>
            <p>This book is like a beautifully written StackOverflow answer that is 1500 pages long. It can be used as a
              reference book as well but you can just sit and read from beginning to end (it is going to take some
              time). The style of writing is really elegant and this book should be near you if you are developing a
              unix application or you are interested in system programming because it is very much likely that the
              questions that you are going to have will have answers in this book.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <p><strong>3. Modern Operating Systems by Andrew S. Tanenbaum</strong></p>
            <p>This is a legendary book written by Tanenbaum. Each book I have seen related to "Systems" by Tanenbaum in
              general was really good at explaining deep technical concepts in a way that makes it understandable by
              students. I think Modern Operating Systems is definitely one of them and you can use it as supplementary
              textbook for CS342: Operating Systems course in Bilkent.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->

              familiar with the name Kevin Mitnick, I would suggest you to do so.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <p><strong>3. Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach by Hennessy &amp; Peterson</strong></p>
            <p>If you have introductory knowledge related to Computer Organization and Architecture and enhance your
              knowledge in these areas. I would recommend using this book coupled up with <a

            <h5 id="-qa76-87-h85-qa76-9-d3-e--1">(QA76.87 .H85 - QA76.9 .D3 E)</h5>
            <p>Here are the Cryptography books that I would recommend reading that are present in our library:</p>
            <p><strong>1. Introduction to Modern Cryptography by Katz &amp; Lindell</strong></p>
            <p>This is a very rigorous and self contained book related to Cryptography. It is really good for learning
              the related formalism for cryptography and it has really detailed proofs about almost every theorem stated
              and it contains a really good chapter that made me understand the Random Oracle Model.</p>
            <!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <p><strong>2. Practical Cryptography by Bruce Schneier &amp; Niels Ferguson</strong></p>
            <p>This is a great book for Applied Cryptography. Actually there is a newer version of this called
              "Cryptography Engineering" but it is in the East Campus. You can still get it from there but it does not
              worth the effort because the content is reasonably similar. Thomas Ptacek has a great <a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210225134657/https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2013/07/22/applied-practical-cryptography/">review
                of "Practical Cryptography"</a>  so I am leaving it here and recommend that you read the <a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210225134657/https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2013/07/22/applied-practical-cryptography/">review</a>.

            <h5 id="-qa247-w7845-qa274-z4813-">(QA247 .W7845 - QA274 .Z4813)</h5>
            <p>This shelf contains many books related to Coding Theory and Error Correcting Codes along with some
              Probability Theory books. It also includes books related to Theory of Computation and Formal Languages.
              This shelf contains some theoretical books related Cryptography as well, but they are going to be
              discussed in a separate section.</p><!--kg-card-begin: gallery-->
            <h3 id="highlights-13">Highlights</h3>
            <p>Here are my recommendations from this shelf:</p>
            <p><strong>1. Coding and Information Theory by Richard W. Hamming</strong></p>
            <p>I have chosen this book because it is written by Hamming, It is a really tiny book and it mostly covers
              the Hamming codes for error correction.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <p><strong>2. A Student's Guide to Coding and Information Theory by Stefan Moser</strong></p>
            <p>This book is brilliant in explaining topics related to Coding and Information Theory, I was able to
              understand some concepts that I was struggling to intuitively understand before such as Mutual Information
              and Relative Entropy using this book.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <p><strong>3. Introduction to Automata Theory Languages and Computation by Hopcroft, Motwani,
                Ullman</strong></p>
            <p>This is an Introductory text book for Automata Theory and Formal Languages. There is a <a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210225134657/https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:ComputerScience+Automata+SelfPaced/about">free
                online course</a> from Stanford University by Jeff Ullman that you can follow along with this book. You
              can also use it as a secondary book while taking CS476: Automata Theory and Formal Languages course.</p>

            <h5 id="-t385-">(T385)</h5>
            <p>This section contain many books related to Computer Graphics. I don't have much to say related to this
              topic since I don't have enough knowledge related to it. But I do know one book related to this topic
              which I am going to highlight.</p>
            <h3 id="highlights-14">Highlights</h3>
            <p>Here are my recommendations from this shelf:</p>
            <p><strong>1. Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice by James D. Foley</strong></p>
            <p>I have seen this book referred as <em>"Bible of Computer Graphics"  </em>in several places online, thus I
              am assuming that it is going to be beneficial for someone who is interested in this topic.</p>
            <!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <p><strong>2. Physical Based Rendering by Matt Pharr</strong></p>
            <p>This book has been suggested by one of the students. It explains the rendering mechanisms of physical
              principles in real life and gives technical details related to the implementation of them.</p>

              Design, Electrical Engineering</h3>
            <h5 id="-tk-">(TK)</h5>
            <p>If you check the congress catalog system above, T stands for technology and TK is the subcategory
              assigned to Electrical Engineering in Bilkent University. I have included this section without using the
              call number range cards because most of the topics are not related to Computer Science directly. But there
              are some topics such as Computer Networks, Digital Logic Design and Hardware Description Languages that is
              going to be useful and  I am going to highlight some books related to this areas.</p>
            <h3 id="highlights-15">Highlights</h3>
            <p>Here are my recommendations from this shelf:</p>
            <p><strong>1. Computer Networks by Andrew S. Tanenbaum</strong></p>
            <p>This is a Bottom-Up approach to Computer Networks written by Tanenbaum. Our CS421: Computer Networks
              course uses a Top-Down approach for teaching the concepts which I think works well. But you should
              consider picking this up and see how the other approach relates to what you already know.</p>
            <!--kg-card-begin: image-->
            <p><strong>2. The Elements of Computing Systems by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken</strong></p>
            <p>This book is acutally designed for a specific course taught by the authors called Building a Modern
              Computer From First Principles. It is also called Nand2Tetris. <a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210225134657/https://www.nand2tetris.org/">Here you can find the
                necessary course material</a>. I have completed this course in the summer of 2016 and I can say that it
              is really beneficial for anyone studying computer science. The course starts with teaching logic gates and
              they have their own simple hardware description language. You are given a nand gate module and you start
              from basic logic gates to writing a simple operating system at the end of the course. All the material is
              designed to be simple and the course has exclusive software related to the tasks. It gives you a survey of
              computer science topics and accumulates introductory knowledge in most of them. </p>
