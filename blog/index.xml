      <description>TL;DR: I don&amp;rsquo;t know what is the exact solution to this problem, but I do know what is not. I believe it is not possible to solve the problem generally (for all research papers at once), but it is possible to solve it partially (based on different research subfields).
Disclaimer: All platforms discussed in this blog post are very good initiatives. This post does not intend to diminish their value. It is just tries to explain what kind of problems they are and aren&amp;rsquo;t solving.</description>

      <description>The cold start problem refers to the lack of accumulation of public questions and discussions for a given research paper over time. A direct cause of this fact is as follows; any reader is in the position of the first person who actually reads the paper, whether the paper is 20 years old or just has been published a week ago. The cold start problem appears in the authorâ€™s perspective as well.</description>
