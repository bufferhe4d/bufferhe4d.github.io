Finally, I have officially started my personal blog, I hope this will be a long but informative journey for me and the readers. I have an "**About**" page so you can find some trivial information about me there but shortly, I am a guy who considers **security** as essential as eating. I will try to post regularly but not on a spesific schedule because I think it is more productive to write when I have the motivation to do it. I don't have much to say for now so take care until next time!
